# Planar Homography of Digitalized Photos

This project aims to correctly digitalize a digital capture of a physical photography. This is the first implementation assignment of the Computer Vision Fundamentals at UFRGS Computer Science program.

## Requirements

1. Python 3 ([windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), [linux](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/))
2. [Virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)

## Installation

This project can be run locally using a python virtual environment. This are the steps to prepare it for Linux and Windows.

### Linux

1. ```git clone https://github.com/ceschini/planar_homography.git```
2. ```cd planar_homography```
3. ```virtualenv .venv```
4. ```source .venv/bin/activate```
5. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Windows

Windows users can double click the ```install_windows.cmd``` script in order to install it. Please make sure you have Python 3 and virtualenv ready for it.

## Usage

Inside the ```scripts``` folder you can find .py files. These files can be executed by running ```python <script>.py``` in a terminal. Just make sure your virtual environment is activated.
